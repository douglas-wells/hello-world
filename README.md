Hey there, earth! *finger-gun-and-wink*


Â¡Hola el mundo!

I'm Doug. I drive a 2014 Mazda 6 (Grand Touring edition) and I work at Baidu USA on the Apollo team. We do a little of this, a bit of that, you know how it is. My favorite hockey player growing up was Mike Ricci, a native of Quebec, Canada. Anyways, good luck and happy trails!
